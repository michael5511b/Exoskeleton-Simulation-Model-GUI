# Exoskeleton Simulation Model GUI

- The base of this GUI is the **"Robot-Arm-Kinematics-MATLAB-Function-package"** in my other repository. For an exoskeleton to operate, it needs to precisely calulate the kinematics of the human arm (essentially a 3-link system). Information such as the instantaneous position, velocity, acceleration, angles, angular velocity, angular acceleration can be provided.

- More detailed documentation, including the **user manual** can be found in the **Report.pdf** file. Note that in the user manual, the main script was named **prosthesis.m**, but I have changed it into **Exoskeleton Simulation Model GUI.m**.
